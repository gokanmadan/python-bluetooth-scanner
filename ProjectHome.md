This is a really fast Bluetooth proximity scanner developed at the University of Michigan's School of Information.  Detected devices can be announced over XMPP, written to a file, and/or posted to a particular URL.  A simple location server is included.

This particular release is a subset of SSAPP (Simple Sensor Architecture for Pervasive Prototyping) developed by Ben Congleton.
